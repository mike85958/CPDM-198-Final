# CPDM-198-Final
CPDM -198
Final Project 


Instructions: 

1.	Design, create, and test Object-Oriented classes for customer banking system based on the deliverables and requirements below. 
2.	Show your understanding of encapsulation using python in the classes. 
3.	Show your understanding of inheritance using python in the classes. 

NOTE: This is your work only.  Do not discuss or share any information.  Any indication thereof will result in failure of the project and the course. 

Deliverables: 

1.	A WORD document (Design Document) showing your classes, its data, and its behaviors (If you are going to show a class that will be inherited in another class, show both classes). 
2.	One python program that has the classes and your testing (Main) in it.  Do not separate classes and import for this project. 
3.	Document the classes. 
4.	Document each of the tests. 
5.	A WORD Document (Approach Document) describing your approach, your successes (if applicable), and your difficulties (if applicable).
a.	Describe your thoughts on defining your classes
b.	Describe how you applied (or tried to apply) encapsulation
c.	Describe how you applied (or tried to apply) inheritance
d.	Describe (if applicable) how you applied polymorphism 

Requirements: 

•	Multiple customer accounts can be created. 
•	The accounts can be either savings or checking
•	The accounts are set up by customer first name, last name, and SSN
•	The savings account has a minimum deposit of $500.00.  
•	The accounts can be added to or deducted from for any customer. 
•	The savings account cannot go below the minimum deposit. 
•	If checking goes below the balance of 0, a fee of $20.00 is applied per transaction. 
•	All deposits to any account must be numeric and above 0.  
•	All deductions from any account must be numeric and above 0. 
•	At any time, the balance for checking and savings can be displayed per customer. 
•	At any time, the total balance for all accounts per customer can be viewed. 
•	The customer can have multiple checking and multiple savings accounts. 
•	Transfer between accounts is permissible.  But; if transferring from checking to savings, checking must be above 0 and if transferring from savings to checking, savings must be above $500.
